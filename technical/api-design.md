## Inside-out API design
- existing backend systems
- internal implementations are exposed through the API
- granular control, direct access to internal processes, and rich functionality

## Outside-in API design
- based on the needs and requirements of external consumers
- Prioritizes simplicity, ease of use, and flexibility
- Produces loosely coupled APIs

## Agile API design
- start work without a completed spec
- Emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and responsiveness to change throughout development
- Iterate quickly to deliver value to consumers while adapting to evolving requirements and priorities
- Encourages close collaboration between stakeholders

## Key stages of API design
- Step 1: Determine what the API is intended to do
- Step 2: Define the API contract with a specification
- Step 3: Validate your assumptions with mocks and tests
- Step 4: Document the API

## Common API design patterns
- Request-response
- Pagination
- Rate limiting
- API authentication and authorization
- Webhooks

## Best practices
- Prioritize consistency
- Gather input from every stakeholder
- Understand the API's context and constraints
